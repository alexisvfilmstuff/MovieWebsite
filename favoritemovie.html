      <p>Upon Gotham City, a new vigilante known as "Red Hood" begins to assemble high-class elites in various crime syndicates,
      making various drug trafficking contracts in return of protecting them from Batman. Through one of his darkest moments;
      Batman must face old scars this vigilante stabs at, reconciling Batman's potential to keep Gotham safe, trying to be a
      fitting replacement for him. Batman faces a dilemma with the vigilante, almost as if he knows him personally and are
      more alike than he thinks, the only difference between them in this disputed battle, is their morale code.
